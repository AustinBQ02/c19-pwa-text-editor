UT Coding Bootcamp Challenge 19: Progressive Web App (PWA) Text Editor


## Description

> Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
